# pdfutils

Just a Python API to get metadata from a pdf file. A while ago I created an npm package for the same purpose, but javascript doesn't have a comprehensible library.

The main purpose of this package is to provide information about the PDF document in Litterarum.

## Requirements

    Our main requirements are
    * Python 3.10
    * pypdf
    * fastapi

The other requirements are in requirements.txt.

## Development

Makes available pip bin and packages installed in the system. Useful if you had used the install pip with get-pip.py script.

```bash
source ./setup-pip.sh
```
